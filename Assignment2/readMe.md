# Tasks 

### Questions 

1. Find and plot the decision boundary between class ω1 and ω2. Assume P(ω1) = P(ω2).
ω1 = [1,6; 3,4; 3,8; 5,6]
ω2 = [3,0; 1,-2;3,-4;5,-2]

2. Find and plot the decision boundary between class ω1 and ω2. Assume P(ω1) =0.3; P(ω2)=0.7
ω1 = [1,-1; 2,-5; 3,-6; 4,-10; 5,-12; 6,-15]
ω2 = [-1,1; -2,5; -3,6; -4,10, -5,12; -6, 15]

3. Find and plot the decision boundary between class ω1 and ω2. Assume P(ω1) = P(ω2).
ω1 = [2,6; 3,4; 3,8; 4,6]
ω2 = [3,0; 1,-2; 3,-4; 5,-2]

4. Implement Bayes Classifier for Iris Dataset.
- _Dataset Specifications_:
- Total number of samples = 150
- Number of classes = 3 (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor)
- Number of samples in each class = 50
- _Use the following information to design classifier_:
- Number of training feature vectors ( first 40 in each class) = 40
- Number of test feature vectors ( remaining 10 in each class) = 10
- Number of dimensions = 4
- Feature vector = <sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width>

5. Use only two features: Petal Length and Petal Width, for 3 class classification and draw thedecision boundary between them (2 dimension, 3 regions also called as multi-class problem)

6. Consider the 128- dimensional feature vectors given in the “face.csv” file.
- _Use the following information to design and implement a Bayes Classifier._
- _Dataset Specifications_:
- Total number of samples = 800
- Number of classes = 2 ( labelled as “male” and “female”)
- Samples from “1 to 400” belongs to class “male”
- Samples from “401 to 800” belongs to class “female”
- Number of samples per class = 400
- Use the following information to design classifier:
- Number of test samples ( first 5 in each class) = 5
- Number of training samples ( remaining 395 in each class) = 395
- Number of dimensions = 128
